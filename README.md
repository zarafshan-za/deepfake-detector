# deepfake-detector
A university project made for a course (Digital Image Processing). This project involves building a deep learning-based image classifier that can detect whether an image is real or deepfake (with 80% accuracy). It utilizes a pretrained CNN model finetuned on a deepfake dataset and includes a modern PyQt-based GUI for user interaction.
